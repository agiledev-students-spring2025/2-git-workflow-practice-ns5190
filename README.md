## Why I Like It

I am interested in using new technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) to help children who lack access to education and/or educational resources. These tools can make learning more accessible for all students and open up opportunities for those who do not learn with traditional teaching. With VR and AR, kids can experience amazing things right in their classrooms, making hard subjects easier to understand and sparking a love for learning.

The article about Code.org and Amazon's new AI curriculum for students caught my eye because it matches my interests. It shows how new education programs can teach kids important AI skills and teach them to use technology responsibly. I love that this curriculum focuses on AI models and community projects, which fits perfectly with my belief that advanced technology in education can bridge gaps and give all kids a fair chance to succeed.
